This project is a web automation application built with Python and Playwright that enables browser automation and testing.

## Features
- Browser automation with Playwright
- Python-based web interaction
- [Add any additional features here]

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- virtualenv (install globally with `pip install virtualenv`)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Installation

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone 
cd MS-Project
```

### Setup the environment
1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
virtualenv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install Playwright browser (Chromium):

## Development
[Add development guidelines here]

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Browser not launching**: Make sure Playwright browsers are properly installed with `python -m playwright install chromium`.

2. **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Virtual environment issues**: If you encounter issues with the virtual environment, try recreating it:
   ```bash
   rm -rf venv
   virtualenv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   ```
